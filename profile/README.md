We're all about introducing our campus to the world of open source tech. Our mission? To nurture a deep appreciation for open source principles and equip students with the skills to thrive in the digital age.

Picture a hub of innovation, where diverse students unite to explore tech's latest trends. We offer engaging projects and interactive sessions in AI, Web Dev, App Dev, AR/VR, and Cloud. Dive into AI and Machine Learning, craft stunning websites in Web Dev, create problem-solving apps, explore AR/VR's immersive realms, and grasp the power of Cloud Computing.

We're not just a club; we're a community of passionate student developers. Join GDSC for peer-to-peer learning, hands-on projects, and real-world solutions that impact local businesses and communities. Our dedicated team organizes vibrant workshops, hackathons, speaker sessions, and collaborations. Exciting things are always afoot!
